This is my first contact with writing smart contracts. I wanted to learn and study some theory but I decided to start doing things, try the tools, make mistakes, among other things.

With this project, I learned about Hardhat, testing, Ropsten, Ropsten Ethereum Faucet, OpenZeppelin and of course some Solidity.

I want to keep learning and coding more complex things and dapps. I really enjoy doing this.
